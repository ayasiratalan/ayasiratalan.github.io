Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Government, housed in the School of Public Affairs at American University. I am also affiliated with the Center for Data Science at American as a graduate fellow. I study comparative politics and quantitative methodology, with focuses on institutions, compliance, political violence, and Bayesian modeling.


My research focuses on understanding  and not directly observable the complex structures that political scientists use. For instance, I am interested in estimation of coup risk of a country or a countries power to deter. 


I am currently working for the Political Analysis journal as a replication analyst. 

Prior to my PhD, I did my undergraduate at Bogazici University in Political Science and International Relations. I also completed MA in Middle Eastern Studies in King's College, London.
