Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Government, housed in the School of Public Affairs at American University. I am also affiliated with the Center for Data Science at American as a graduate fellow. I study comparative politics and quantitative methodology, with focuses on institutions, compliance, political violence, and Bayesian modeling.
